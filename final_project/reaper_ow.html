    <img src="images/reaper5.png" alt title="Reaping logo">
    <h4> The Reaping </h4>
    <p> Reaper steals health from his enemies as he damages them. The healing comes from 20% of hero damage dealt using his kit like his HellFire Shotguns, Death Blossom, or melee.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> This provides Reaper with a steady stream of healing while in combat so he doesn't have to run towards health kits scatter throughout the map. </li>
        <li> This can provide Reaper with valuable in-combat healing. If up against multiple opponents, it's best to target to high HP heroes and he can withstand combat </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Weapon </h3>
    <img src="images/reaper1.png" alt title="Hellfire Shotguns">
    <h4> Hellfire Shotguns </h4>
    <p> Reaper tears apart his enemies with his twin shotguns.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Hellfire Shotguns deal high damage at short range, allowing Reaper to quickly kill targets that he gets the jump on, this is great on tank heroes since they have big hitboxes compared to other heroes.</li>
        <li> As the shotguns have high damage falloff,get up and personal with them to get full advantage. </li>

        <h3> Abilities </h3>
        <img src="images/reaper2.png" alt title="Wraith logo">
        <h4> Wraith Form </h4>
        <p> Reaper becomes a shadow for a short time. In his wraith form he becomes invulnerable and is able to pass through enemies, but can't shoot or use any of his other abilities </p>
        <ul>
            <li> This is Reaper's main method of escape. If you suddenly find yourself surrounded by enemies be sure to use this ability since you're immune any damage in the game. </li>
            <li> If used correctly Reaper can use the "hit and run" strat, which he basically dips into enemy lines and kill ones then wraths out. </li>


        </ul>
        <img src="images/reaper3.png" alt title="Shadow Step Logo">
        <h4> Shadow Step </h4>
        <p> After Reaper marks a destination with the shadow, Reaper disappears and then reappears at that marked location. </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Use this to teleport into flanking areas without being noticed.</li>
            <li> This is also perfect to set up a great drop down death blossom to catch the enemy out guard. </li>

        </ul>
        <img src="images/reaper4.png" alt title="Death Blossom Logo">
        <h4> Death Blossom </h4>
        <p> In a blur of motion, Reaper use his hellfire shotguns at imense speed, dealing insane damage to nearby enemies. When activated, Reaper shoots his shotguns in a large A.O.E (Area of Effect) around him, dealing mass damage to nearby enemies. </p>

        <ul>
            <li> One of the deadliest Ultimates in the game against a stacked enemy team. Look for opportunities where your opponents are clumped together and where you can silently approach to unleash Death Blossom </li>
            <li> This can be treated as your weapon, meaning that it can be block by barriers, be sure to coordinate with your team to break any barriers to give death blossom maximum potential </li>
        </ul>
