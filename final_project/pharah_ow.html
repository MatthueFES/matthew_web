    <h1> Pharah </h1>
    <p> Pharah takes the action to skies, armed with a rocket launcher she barrages down high-explosive rockets. She removes the style of boots on the ground gameplay and make other players keep a keen eye on the skies. </p>

    <h3> Passive Abilities </h3>
    <h4> Hover Jets </h4>
    <p> Pharah lifts herself upward with her jetpack, it allows her to gain height by holding either the jump or the alt-fire and tapping it allows her to remain at the same height. It refills automatically when it isn't being use taking only two seconds
        to refill from empty to full.</p>

    <h3> Weapon </h3>
    <img src="images/pharah1.png" alt title="rocket launcher">
    <h4> Rocket Launcher </h4>
    <p> Pharah primary weapon shoots out rockets that deal damages in a A.O.E radius or the rocket can hit the enemy directly dealing massive damage compared to the A.O.E damage. (There is knockback to can also affct herself). </p>
    <ul>
        <li> If not engaged with any enemies in combat, her rocket launcher are a perfect use for spamming areas for area control.</li>
        <li> Pharah rockets can be also used for a source of altitude, by shooting down while using jump jet you can gain more height rather than just a regular jump jet.</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="images/pharah2.png" alt title="Jump jet">
    <h4> Jump Jet </h4>
    <p> Pharah propells herself by suit's thruster which lets her gain a maximum range of 20 meters vertically with a 10 secs cooldown.</p>
    <p> This can be used to go over gaps while gaining height and can be used as a escape option.</p>
    <img src="images/pharah3.png" alt title="Concussive blast">
    <h4> Concussive Blast </h4>
    <p> Pharah shoots on a small rocket to doesn't do damage but instead knockbacks the enemies and can be used on herself. This can be also be used as a source of mobility as she can reposition herself and her enemies. </p>
    <ul>
        <li> While jump jet gives vertical distance, concussive blast can give horizontal distance by blasting herself giving no damaged knockback to herself.</li>
        <li> This is an ideal ability to use where enviromental hazards are around, use this to knock the enemies down pits or cliffs.</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="images/pharah4.png" alt title="Barrage Ultimate">
    <h4> Barrage </h4>
    <p> Pharah controls a continous barrage of mini rockets to reign from above on her foes. When using her ultimate she remains stationary but can turn and hover in the air if it was used mid-air.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> While this can be one of the most dangerous ultimates out there, this leaves her in a vulnerable position where anyone can shoot her down in a instant. </li>
        <li> It's ideal to use this as close to nearby enemies to give them a quick surprise.</li>
    </ul>

 <br>
<p> If you can master hitting direct hits on enemies, you can make a big difference in a teamfight.</p>
