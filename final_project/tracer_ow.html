    <h4> Blink </h4>
    <p> This ability is one of most important features of tracer. Blink allows tracer to teleport over a short distance in the direction she is moving. (the maximum charge of blinks is 3.) This ablility allows her to move unpredictable able to confuse her
        enemies giving a massive advantage.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> A good tip is to make sure where you blinking into, it's a good idea to have map awareness otherwise you might blink into a wall and wont understand why you weren't moving. </li>
        <li> Using multiple blinks at the same time can allow tracer to cross chokepoints or large gaps without trouble</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="images/tracer3.png" alt title="Recall">
    <h4> Recall </h4>
    <p> When activated, Tracer will rewind to three seconds in the past, Setting her HP and position at that time. it also reloads her pistol and removes debuff.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recall is usually a way to restore hp back from combat, but can be a great way to bait enemies to your teammates or to outplay them. </li>
        <li> When tracer is in animation, she will become invisible and invicible for that time. </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/tracer4.png" alt title="Pulse Bomb">
    <h4> Pulse Bomb </h4>
    <p> Tracer throws a bomb that sticks on any surface if thrown on it. After a couple of seconds, the bomb explodes dealing explosive damages. </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Pulse Bomb is devastating on grouped up enemies or defenses like Bastion under Sentry mode. </li>
        <li> Pulse Bomb synergizes very well with abilities such as Zarya's Graviton Surge. The combination of these ultimates will usually wipe out the majority of an enemies team and severely damage their tanks. </li>
        <li> Quick tip: Be careful not to kill yourself with your bomb. You're not safe from your own bomb! </li>
    </ul>
