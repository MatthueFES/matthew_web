    <h1> Bastion</h1>
    <p> Repair protocols and the ability to transform between stationary Assault, mobile Recon and devastating Tank configurations provide Bastion with a high probability of victory. </p>

    <h3> Passive </h3>
    <img src="images/ironclad.png" alt title="ironclad logo">
    <h4> Ironclad </h4>
    <ul>
        <li> Bastion's passive ability. It takes 20% reduction damage while in Sentry and Tank configuration. </li>
        <li> Ironclad will take the lead in reducing all incoming damage before the armor reduces the remained outcome. </li>
        <li> Bastion has to finish the transformation to get this passive ability. As it will still receive normal damage while transforming, try not to use it as an instant defensive against heavy damage. </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/bastion1.png" alt title="recon logo">
    <h4> Configuration Recon </h4>
    <p> Bastion's primary form. The primary form of Bastion features a submachine-gun attached to its right arm as its weapon. The weapon fires hitscan bullets with high accuracy. </p>
    <ul>
        <li> While the main role of this form is to find a spot to transform into Sentry, the weapon itself deals a good amount of damage; per shot, the damage is the same as Soldier: 76's Pulse Rifle, but with slightly lower range and fire rate, but smaller
            spread. It can kite a sniper or airborne target while keeping itself moving rather than being a stationary turret, easy to be shot down. </li>
        <li> In the case of engaging a mobile enemy, fighting with this mode is recommended over transforming into Sentry, as it can deal a critical shot while the other cannot. Defensively, it also has a higher chance to disengage if the fight isn't in its
            favor rather than being stuck in an immobile form, and it does not have a weak spot on its back while in Recon, which is easy for mobile enemies to target otherwise. </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/bastion2.png" alt title="Sentry logo">
    <h4> Configuration Sentry </h4>
    <p> Bastion's secondary form. After finishing the transformation, It will become a stationary turret equipped with a gatling gun capable of unleashing a hail of bullets. Bastion's weak point will be changed from its head to its back, which is opposite
        to the targeted point of view. The downside of this form is it becomes an immobile target and unable to deal a critical shot. </p>

    <ul>
        <li> Sentry form works best on a fixed area where the enemy is likely to be in; such as choke point, enclosed spaces or a doorway. </li>
        <li> Bastion will not receive any knockback from enemy attacks, like Roadhog's Whole Hog or Lucio's Soundwave.</li>
        <li> Although Bastion has Ironclad and Self-Repair to help it withstand attacks, without a Barrier from an ally such as Reinhardt or Orisa, it can easily become a sitting duck as it draws enemy fire due to being a high-damage stationary target. </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/bastion3.png" alt title="reconfigure">
    <h4> Reconfigure</h4>
    <p> Bastion's transformation skill. It changes to Configuration: Sentry within 1 second, while it changes back to Configuration: Recon within only 0.5 seconds. </p>
    <img src="images/bastion4.png" alt title="Self repair logo">
    <h4> Self-Repair </h4>
    <p> Bastion's method of self-healing. It will repair itself for up to 4 seconds; this can be stopped by the player at any time. It can heal 25% of its health per second, making this a powerful self-healing. Bastion can freely move and heal at the same
        time, and can't be interrupted by enemy attack. </p>
    <img src="images/bastion5.png" alt title="Tank ultimate">
    <h4> Configuration Tank (Ultimate) </h4>
    <p> Bastion's Ultimate form. After it has finished the transformation for 1.5 seconds, it changes itself to a tank model and replaces its previous weapon with an explosive cannon, which deals heavy damage and creates a strong knockback around the blast.
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Bastion has no weak point and benefits from Ironclad in this form, making it strong against direct fire from enemies. </li>
        <li> While losing some damage output in comparison to Sentry form, Bastion gains crowd-control ability in return from the explosive cannon. </li>
    </ul>

<p> This person took bastion base kit and made an entirely new playstyle with it, being more offensive than defensive!</p>
