    <ul>
        <li>The first couple bullets are acurate with your crosshair, this encourages you to fire in short burst for maximum control on the recoil the heavy pulse rifle packs.</li>
        <li> Since the bullets is hit-scan based, be sure to practise tracing over enemy movements </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/soldier2.png" alt title="Rocket">
    <h4> Helix Rocket </h4>
    <p> When activated, Soldier 76 fires out rockets from his Heavy Pulse Rifle, the rockets acts as a single rocket, either exploding on an enemy or on a surface. </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Since this can be used as a burst damage ability, it's best to use this to kill enemies before they escape or use an ability </li>
        <li> If you're unsure that you can't directly hit the enemy, just aim at the general ground area as the a.o.e can pack a punch.
    </ul>

    <img src="images/soldier3.png" alt title="sprint">
    <h4> Sprint </h4>
    <p> Soldier begins to sprint, increasing his movement speed. This disadvantage is that he can't fire his weapons, but can use any ability canceling his sprint. </p>
    <p> Sprint is a incredibly important tool for soldier, this can save soldier in most worst case scenarios since most can keep up with his speed overtime. </p>

    <img src="images/soldier4.png" alt title="biotic field">
    <h4> Biotic Field </h4>
    <p> When ativated, Soldier 76 will drop down a biotic field. This will dipense a healing circle where both him and his allies will be hill winthin the circle radius. This will only last for a few sceonds before dissappearing.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Beware that the animation that soldier76 plays when dropping down his biotic field will cancel any prior animations like reloading or sprinting. </li>
        <li> The biotic field will stick on any surface, so you can drop it on the payload and it'll stick on it.</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="images/soldier5.png" alt title="tactical visor">
    <h4> Tactical Visor </h4>
    <p> When activated, 76 gains a special crosshair that lasts for several seconds. All of the shots from his Heavy Pulse Rifle will automatically hit the enemy that is closest to the center of these crosshairs. In addition, his Heavy Pulse Rifle reloads
        faster for the duration. As Tactical Visor works like you firing normal attack, the falloff damage is working on this point. Even if you have the perfect accuracy that be able to track the enemies, you will deal lower damage when you are outside
        of the effective range of Pulse Rifle. </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Tatical Visor is perfect for hitting evasive characters like tracer, genji with exact accuracy. </li>
        <li> Make sure to priortize enemies correctly whether from evasive heroes or those hard to kill supports </li>
        <li> Don't worry about aiming properly, it's reccomended to focus more on dodging the enemies shots </li>
    </ul>
<p> After countless hours of playing soldier76 you're bound to have great skill</p>
